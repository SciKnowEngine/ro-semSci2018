# Towards Evidence Extraction: Analysis of Scientific Figures from Studies of Molecular Interactions

This repository describes a [Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/) for the data and analysis reported in the paper:

> Burns, et al (2018) "Towards Evidence Extraction: Analysis of Scientific Figures from Studies of Molecular Interactions" [SemSci Workshop 2018](https://semsci.github.io/SemSci2018/). 

The [manifest.ttl](manifest.ttl) file provides linked data for the resources (software and data) used in the data processing that generated this paper. This involves links to three datasets hosted on Zenodo and three software tools hosted on Github. None of these resources are currently linked data / research objects, but we will seek to incorporate more detailed semantic representations of these elements going forward.
